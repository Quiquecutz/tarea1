        Nobody’s <strong>born</strong> smart. <strong>We all start at 0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
       <em>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br></em>
        <strong>And Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating.</em> Confusing. Trying. <em>Struggling.<br></em>
        <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</em><br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
       <em> <strong>Failing </strong>is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br></em>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
